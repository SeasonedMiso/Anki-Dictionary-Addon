    shouldnt all of the like bs4 and stuff be in a libs dir or something?

    right now the user files are not being properly generated etc... Would be nice if they transfer with anki web account... should all be in gitignore

    UI is kinda shit tbh



After phase 4, is the refactor done? Please can you check the code base and look for other things to make the codebase fully refactored.
